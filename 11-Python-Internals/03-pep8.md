ðŸŸ¢ .pyc Files in Python â€” Detailed Explanation
ðŸ”¹ 1. What are .pyc files?

.pyc files are compiled Python files.

When Python source code (.py) is executed, CPython compiles it into bytecode and saves it as a .pyc file.

Bytecode is platform-independent and executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

.pyc stands for Python Compiled file.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Purpose of .pyc files

Speed up execution:

Python doesnâ€™t need to recompile the source code every time it runs.

PVM can directly execute the bytecode stored in .pyc.

Cache mechanism:

CPython stores compiled bytecode in __pycache__/ folder for future runs.

ðŸ”¹ 3. How .pyc Files Are Created

When you run a Python file:

python example.py


CPython compiles the code to bytecode.

It checks if a .pyc file exists in the __pycache__/ folder:

If not present or outdated, it creates a new .pyc.

If present and up-to-date, Python uses the .pyc to execute code faster.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Location and Naming

.pyc files are stored in the __pycache__/ directory inside the project folder.

Naming convention:

<module_name>.cpython-<python_version>.pyc


Example:

example.py -> __pycache__/example.cpython-310.pyc


Here, 310 indicates Python 3.10 version.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Execution Flow with .pyc

Python checks if the .pyc file exists and is valid.

If valid, loads bytecode from .pyc.

Executes bytecode on Python Virtual Machine.

If invalid or missing, recompiles .py to .pyc and executes.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Can We Run .pyc Files Directly?

Yes, you can run .pyc files using Python interpreter:

python __pycache__/example.cpython-310.pyc


But usually, you run the .py file; Python handles .pyc internally.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Advantages of .pyc Files

Faster startup â€” avoids recompilation.

Obfuscation â€” source code is not directly visible (not secure, but hides plain code).

Cross-platform â€” bytecode runs on any OS with same Python version.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Disadvantages

.pyc files are Python version-specific.

They donâ€™t prevent reverse engineering (can be decompiled).

If .py changes, old .pyc may become outdated.

ðŸ”¹ 9. Summary

.pyc files are compiled Python bytecode.

Stored in __pycache__/ with Python version info.

Speed up execution by avoiding repeated compilation.

Python automatically handles .pyc creation and usage.
