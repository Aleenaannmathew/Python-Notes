ðŸŸ¢ Memory Management in Python â€” Memory Basics
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Memory Management?

Memory management is the process of allocating, using, and freeing memory in a program.

It ensures that your Python program efficiently uses RAM without memory leaks.

Python provides automatic memory management, meaning you donâ€™t need to manually allocate or free memory like in C/C++.

ðŸ”¹ 2. How Python Manages Memory

Python uses a private heap to store all objects and data structures.

The Python memory manager handles the allocation of memory for different objects (integers, lists, strings, etc.).

Pythonâ€™s memory is managed automatically, but understanding it helps in writing efficient programs.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Python Memory Components
a) Stack

Stores function calls and local variables.

Last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure.

Automatically managed when a function ends.

b) Heap

Stores all Python objects and data structures.

Managed by the Python memory manager.

Memory in heap is shared across functions.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Object Lifetime

Every Python object has a lifetime determined by reference count and garbage collection:

Creation â€” Memory is allocated when the object is created.

Use â€” Object is used as long as references exist.

Deletion â€” Memory is released when the object is no longer referenced.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Reference Counting

Python keeps a count of references to each object.

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a   # Reference count of list increases
del a   # Reference count decreases


When the reference count becomes 0, the object is automatically deleted.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Memory Pools

Python uses pymalloc, a specialized allocator, to manage small objects efficiently.

Memory blocks are grouped in pools, reducing overhead and improving performance.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Interning for Optimization

Python interns immutable objects (like small integers and strings) for memory efficiency.

a = 100
b = 100
print(a is b)  # True, both point to same memory


This saves memory and improves performance by reusing objects.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Dynamic Memory Allocation

Python dynamically allocates memory as needed for lists, dicts, and other objects.

Example:

lst = []           # Empty list allocated
lst.append(10)     # Python reallocates memory as list grows

ðŸ”¹ 9. Memory Efficiency Tips

Use generators instead of lists for large data.

Delete unnecessary variables using del.

Avoid circular references (objects referencing each other) unless needed.

Use slots in classes to save memory:

class Point:
    __slots__ = ['x', 'y']
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
