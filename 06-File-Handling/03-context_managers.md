ðŸŸ¢ Python File Handling â€” Context Managers

Context managers in Python provide a clean, safe, and efficient way to handle resources like files. They ensure that resources are properly acquired and released, even if errors occur.

ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a Context Manager?

A context manager is a Python construct that automatically manages setup and teardown operations.

In file handling, it opens and closes the file automatically:

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()


with â†’ starts the context

file â†’ file object

After the block, file is automatically closed, no need for file.close().

âœ… Using context managers prevents resource leaks and ensures safe file handling.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Why Use Context Managers for Files?

Automatically closes files, even on exceptions.

Reduces boilerplate code: no need for try/finally.

Makes code cleaner and more readable.

Without context manager:

file = open("example.txt", "r")
try:
    content = file.read()
finally:
    file.close()


With context manager:

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()


The with statement internally handles try/finally.

ðŸ”¹ 3. File Handling Modes with Context Managers

You can use any file mode with with:

# Writing
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")

# Appending
with open("example.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("\nAppending new line")

# Reading
with open("example.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())


âœ… No need to explicitly call f.close(); it's automatic.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Multiple Files in One Context

You can manage multiple files in a single with statement:

with open("input.txt", "r") as infile, open("output.txt", "w") as outfile:
    for line in infile:
        outfile.write(line.upper())


Automatically closes both files after the block.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Using contextlib for Custom Context Managers

Python provides the contextlib module to create custom context managers.

5.1 Using @contextmanager
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def open_file(file_name, mode):
    f = open(file_name, mode)
    try:
        yield f
    finally:
        f.close()

with open_file("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Custom context manager")


yield â†’ provides the resource to the with block

finally â†’ ensures resource cleanup

5.2 Using a Class
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.file.close()

with FileManager("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Using class-based context manager")


__enter__ â†’ runs at the start of with block

__exit__ â†’ runs at the end of with block, handles exceptions if any

ðŸ”¹ 6. Advantages of Context Managers

Automatic resource management

Cleaner, readable code

Reduces errors like forgetting to close a file

Works with any resource: files, network connections, database connections, locks, etc.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Exceptions Handling in Context Managers

__exit__ can handle exceptions.

class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.file.close()
        if exc_type:
            print(f"An exception occurred: {exc_value}")
        return True  # Suppresses exception


Returning True â†’ suppresses exception

Returning False â†’ exception propagates normally
