## What is Python

Python is a **high-level, general-purpose, compiled and interpreted, garbage-collected, and object-oriented programming language**. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.  

Python emphasizes **readability, simplicity, and ease of use**, making it popular for **web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and more**.  

**Key Characteristics:**
- Interpreted and dynamically typed  
- High-level language with simple syntax  
- Open-source with a large community  
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Features of Python

1. **Simple and Easy to Learn** â€“ Pythonâ€™s syntax is clean and readable.  
2. **Interpreted Language** â€“ Code is executed line by line, which helps with debugging.  
3. **Dynamically Typed** â€“ No need to declare variable types explicitly.  
4. **Object-Oriented** â€“ Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.  
5. **Extensive Standard Library** â€“ Includes modules for file handling, networking, web services, databases, and more.  
6. **Portable and Cross-Platform** â€“ Python code runs on different operating systems without modification.  
7. **Extensible** â€“ Can integrate with C, C++, and Java modules.  
8. **Embeddable** â€“ Python can be embedded into other languages to provide scripting capabilities.  
9. **Large Community Support** â€“ Many resources, tutorials, and libraries available.
